# UploadToS3

Backend to upload data to S3 directly

# Process being followed.

1. Use NodeJS to upload the images to the backend from react.
2. Process the Image on the backend in NodeJS and upload to S3 as required.
3. Retrieval will also be done using NodeJS.

Longer process even though this might be more suitable in the real world due to a huge dependence on AWS in the front-end code.
